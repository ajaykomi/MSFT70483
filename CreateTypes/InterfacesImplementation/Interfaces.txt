A class that implements an interface can explicitly implement a member of that interface. 
When a member is explicitly implemented, it cannot be accessed through a class instance, but only through an instance of the interface. 

This enables the programmers to implement multiple interfaces if the  interfaces have similar memebers

Interfaces can accept the following to be their members

1. Properties - Popular
2. Events
3. Indexers
4. Methods - Popular
