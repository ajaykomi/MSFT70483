Encapsulation is to enclose the scope of few elements in an object to enable the programmer to implement desired level of abstraction for the particular 
physical or logical package.

C# supports following access modifiers

public
private : Only methods of the same class can access its private members. Even an instance of a class or a classs in the same namespace cannot access its private members.
protected: Protected access specifier allows a child class to access the member variables and member functions of its base class 
internal: Internal access specifier allows a class to expose its member variables and member functions to other functions and objects in the current assembly.
protected internal

Further we will see each one with examples (in the code module) and determine the order of access level from highest access to the lowest access modifier
